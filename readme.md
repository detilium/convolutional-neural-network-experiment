# Convolutional neural network
The purpose of this repository, is to try and build a convolutional neural network
from scratch, without using any packages like PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.

This experiment project is highly influenced by https://www.pycodemates.com/2023/07/build-a-cnn-from-scratch-using-python.html
